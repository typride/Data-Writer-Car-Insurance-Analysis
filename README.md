This notebook exemplifies the type of analytics and data manipulation that I can do with any data source with Python and its data science libaries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplot, and Seaborn. I have included titles above each section and a description beneath each title to further explain what the section achieves.

The beginning of the notebook walks you through some data exploration via some standard statistics breakdowns and some visualizations of all variables, as seen in the "seaborn" cell.

I've included a title that briefly explains what my reasoning is for including the code below it, and, when necessary, I've included a more detailed explanation underneath the title wording. 

> If you have any questions or problems accessing, loading, <br> reading or understanding anything I've included, please <br> don't hesitate to reach out and chat with me about it.

The idea of a document like this is to not only convey my process, but also show how this sort of document could be used to educate other writers on how to adjust the data themselves. In other words, it's a template for the education of other writers in data science with Python. 

Each of these cells is editable, if you'd like to adjust them yourself for any reason. If the cell is not editable, it's because I've made it that way on purpose. 


#### Overview:
Clicking them won't work until you open the file -- so do it, silly!

1. [Quick and dirty metrics about the data with Seaborn](#Let's-see-some-quick-and-dirty-metrics)
2. [A Stats breakdown (numbers)](#A-little-stats-breakdown)
3. [Cheapest insurance for men w/ one speeding ticket](#How-'bout-we-look-into-the-question,-what-is-the-cheapest-insurance-for-young-men-with-at-least-one-speeding-ticket?)
4. [Using box plot to visualize data further](#Seems-like-a-boxplot-would-be-helpful-in-analyzing-this!)
5. [Median for Geico & USAA in 1st analysis](#It-looks-like-Geico-and-USAA-are-similar,-let's-dig-deeper.-.-.)
6. [Breakdown for other companies](#What-about-the-other-companies?-What-are-their-median-costs-for-reference-later?)
7. [Women in the same category?](#What-about-Women-in-the-same-category?)
8. [Medians for women](#And,-again,-let's-print-out-the-medians.)
9. [Other ages, same metrics](#Great,-now-we-have-the-data-for-young-adults-with-speeding-tickets.-Let's-expand-this-further-for-more-ages,-and-for-more-infractions.)
10. [Visualizaions for all ages](#Now-that-we-have-a-list-of-each-subset-of-the-data,-let's-make-some-visualizations.)
11. [Medians for this new list of all ages](#Let's-get-the-median-for-each-of-these-data-sets.)
12. [Export data for use by anyone](#Now-we-have-the-data-in-a-format-that-we-can-export-to-.csv,-if-we-want!)
13. [DONE, now other examples?](#That's-all-for-the-data-explanation..-Below-there's-just-some-other-examples-of-useful-data-manipulation/analysis-to-further-show-what-is-possible)

Thanks!

Otherwise, I hope you enjoy!
